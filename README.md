# Nano Music Player ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janhrastnik/flutter-music-player/master/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/icon.png)

Simple local music player built with flutter. It uses the [audioplayer](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/audioplayer#-readme-tab-) plugin to play files, and [path_provider](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/path_provider#-readme-tab-) to locate the external directory and search it for playable files. Metadata is gathered through native java code. You can download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=janhrastnik.musicplayer2).
